    "description": "Most engineers debug errors. I debug chaos. I’m Onyeibor Samuel, a fullstack developer who brings clarity to messy systems using Python, React, and cloud tech. I’ve built tools that power real lives, not just portfolios and I believe clean code is a form of respect: to users, to teammates, and to the future. I’m not applying just to work here, I’m applying to outbuild expectations.I craft scalable software that feels simple, no matter how complex the backend. I don’t just solve problems.., I make them disappear.\nAnd while I’ve already shipped things that matter, I’m even more excited by what I haven’t learned yet. I’m hungry to grow, obsessed with learning, and ready to earn my place, one commit at a time.",
